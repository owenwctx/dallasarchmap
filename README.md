A map of key pieces of Dallas architecture, starting with Mark Lamster's list of 100 locations. 

This map was spawned by a Tweet from Juan Pablo Garnham regarding Mark Lamster's list of 100 architectural gems in Dallas. You can read the original piece in the Dallas Morning News here, or explore this webmap. 

Over time we can add additional locations to round out a list of exciting architecture in Dallas.
